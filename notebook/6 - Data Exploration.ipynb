    "And, yes Spark, you would be absolutely correct. I won't pretend to be a Spark expert after scouring the internet for random tutorial videos, but you know what? I feel like I have enough knowledge to get started. So, let's do just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, having the data on S3 really helps us here, and I'm starting to quickly appreciate the integrated-ness (definitely not a word) of AWS' suite of services. In the case of EMR, S3 actually integrates directly with it as a distributed storage source (replacing HDFS). All this is abstracted to us, and I'll just keep my mind naive for now until I need to deal with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I have to set up a few packages that will help me integrate Spark with Jupyter. By default, EMR comes with the Zeppelin notebook which integrates directly into Spark out of the box, but I'm going with Jupyter because it's what I'm more familiar with (Zeppelin actually looks pretty cool though, built in interactive visualizations from SQL results!) and it translates better to a blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **findspark** package will allow us to connect up SparkSession with our Jupyter notebook, and the **sql\\_magic** package will allow us to add the SQL \"Magic\" command capabilities, that is, to actually write in-line SQL statements to query our Spark dataframes using Spark SQL (back in the [all-nba predict](https://strikingmoose.com/2017/07/28/exploration-of-historical-nba-players-part-ii-scatterplot-matrices/) days, we were using the R magic commands to pass dataframes back and forth between R and Python)."

    "Let's use the **findspark** package to connect Jupyter up to the Spark shell. The first thing we do apparently in any new Spark application is initiate a SparkSession. When you initiate a Spark shell from command line, or open up Zeppelin, a SparkSession will already be instantiated as the _**spark**_ object. In Jupyter, we can either actually set up Jupyter on the server-side to recognize the Spark shell, or we can use _**findspark**_ to be able to work within the Spark shell within our Python shell, which we have chosen Jupyter to open up with. Therefore, we have to initiate this SparkSession ourselves. The SparkSession is an object that will provide an entry point into all the different APIs (e.g. Spark SQL that we will be using later) and also tracks the application being spun up so we can view it and tag it in the Spark History Server console."

    "and Jupyter was available on the master node at port 8889 (8888 was used for Zeppelin by default on EMR). Hopefuly everything makes sense so far! As I'm working in this notebook right now, I'm working on the master node. The master node is not only providing an interface for me to interact with Spark via Jupyter, but its also acting as my Spark application's master who is generating the DAG, pushing individual tasks as defined by the DAG down to the appropriate workers, and collecting the results back from the workers and presenting it back to me when I run an action.\n",

I could just be talking out of my arse though, maybe a comparison to try for another day! At this point, we'll say that 35 seconds is fair as it does have to scan the dataframe to infer the schema (and it probably does this in a distributed way)\n",

We see that it took around 10 seconds to load the first 10 rows of the dataframe. Is this efficient? At the number of data we pulled? Probably not. I could imagine a head(10) on a normal Pandas dataframe doesn't take more than a few milliseconds! However, we see some of the distributed overhead at work here.

This is purely me trying to visualize _**one possibility**_ in which the DAG could be carried out. At this point, I'm actually not even sure if both workers are doing the work, Spark may have some built in intelligence to say that only a single worker is required here, but for demonstration purposes of distributed computing, I wanted to just visualize a super simple distributed task for myself.\n",
