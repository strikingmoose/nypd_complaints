    "# Spinning Up EMR Cluster (Continued)\n",

    "It looks like the cluster is up. That took about 10 minutes to get to this stage with the two _**Running**_ statuses showing up. It still says \"Waiting\" up top... but I'm not really sure what that means. If I click _**Spark**_ under _**Connections**_, sure enough, I see the Spark web interface come up:\n",
