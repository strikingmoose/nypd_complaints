    "I'm so confused I don't even know what to review. In the last post, I used Spark to load a file, tried to cluster, and ran into a memory issue. Made some changes, clustered, did some SQL, tried to transform the data with a one-hot encoder, and ran into more memory issues... Again, we're talking about _**16GB OF WORKING MEMORY FOR A 1.3GB RAW CSV**_. I'm so confused, but clearly I took too large of a step than I was ready for. Let's try to start with the basics here and pay closer attention to memory usage within the cluster.\n",

    "After I write this paragraph, I'm going to turn down my cluster, start a new one, and have nothing running... I'd expect 24GB of free memory right now, maybe a bit of overhead memory consumption for node and Spark operation, but I would assume no more than 1GB per cluster maybe?\n",

    "Well, I'm glad I didn't make any bets on that, because that could not be further from the truth. At a standing state, _**HALF OF MY CLUSTER'S MEMORY IS USED UP**_? Let's take a deeper look at the nodes. Note that _**10.0.0.246**_ is my master node.\n",
